# Personal Website (2015 - 2017)

This is the website I used for myself while I was studying for my masters. I was built using HTML and Bootstrap 3.

The main page contained some information about myself and a carousel where the user can view the projects I did at university.

This was the initial view of the main page:

By scrolling down or clicking links in the navbar, the user could read some paragraphs about me and see a selection of my projects, in a carousel:

Clicking on "here" navaigated to a page with a list of all projects. Clicking any of the titles expands the section to show a brief description and a "Show more" button

Clicking "Show more" navigates to a page with more information about the specific project
